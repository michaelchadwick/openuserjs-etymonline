# openuserjs-etymonline
This is an [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org) file used with browser extensions like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) to modify the front-end of a website to your choosing.

The script largely makes [Etymonline](http://etymonline.com), an online etymology dictionary, more responsive to compete with the modern web. It didn't need much, but it's better now!
